#lamport and vector logical-clock-simulator

it is just fucken dumy lamport and vector logical clock simulator by me

it requires pygame

for lamport locgical clock simulator enter in folder lamport and for vector logical clock simulator enter in folder vector  and
run simul.py then enter a number of proceses you want to simulate with logical clock then press blue lables that apper and 
try the efects by pressing labels that apear above blue labels 

this is dumy simulator it did not use real proceses instead it use process object so do not use it for school and real projects without modifing it 10q
