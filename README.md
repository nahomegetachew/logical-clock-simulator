Lamport and Vector Logical Clock Simulator

This is a simple simulator for Lamport and Vector Logical Clocks, created by Nahome Getachew. It provides a visual representation of how these logical clocks work. Please note that this simulator is intended for educational purposes and should not be used for real-world or production projects without proper modifications.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Pygame library

Installation

    Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

    Install the required dependencies using the following command:

    pip install pygame
    ```

Usage
Lamport Logical Clock Simulator

    Navigate to the lamport folder.
    Run the simul.py script.
    Enter the number of processes you want to simulate with logical clocks.
    Press the blue labels that appear on the screen to trigger events and observe the effects on the logical clocks.

Vector Logical Clock Simulator

    Navigate to the vector folder.
    Run the simul.py script.
    Enter the number of processes you want to simulate with logical clocks.
    Press the blue labels that appear on the screen to trigger events and observe the effects on the logical clocks.

Important Note
